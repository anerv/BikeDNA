For the topology of the network, however, only those nodes that are endpoints or intersection points with other edges are needed, while all other (so-called 'interstitial') nodes do not add any information. To compare the structure and true ratio between nodes and edges in a network, a simplified network representation which only includes nodes at endpoints and intersections, or where the value of important attributes changes, is required. An additional advantage of simplifying the network is the resulting substantial reduction of the number of nodes and edges, which makes computational routines much faster.\n",
