    "# 2b. Intrinsic Analysis of Reference Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook analyses the quality of a user-provided reference bicycle infrastructure data set for a given area. The quality assessment is *intrinsic*, i.e. based only on the one input data set, and making no use of information external to the data set. For an extrinsic quality assessment that compares the reference data set to corresponding OSM data, see the notebooks 3a and 3b.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis assesses the *fitness for purpose* ([Barron et al., 2014](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tgis.12073)) of the reference data for a given area. Outcomes of the analysis can be relevant for bicycle planning and research - especially for projects that include a network analysis of bicycle infrastructure, in which case the topology of the geometries is of particular importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the assessment does not make use of an external reference data set as the ground truth, no universal claims of data quality can be made. The idea is rather to enable those working with bicycle networks to assess whether their data are good enough for their particular use case. The analysis assists in finding potential data quality issues but leaves the final interpretation of the results to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook makes use of quality metrics from a range of previous projects investigating OSM/VGI data quality, such as [Ferster et al. (2020)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15568318.2018.1519746), [Hochmair et al. (2015)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tgis.12081), [Barron et al.

    "### Network density\n",
    "\n",
    "In this setting, network density refers to the length of edges or number of nodes per km2. This is the usual definition of network density in spatial (road) networks, which is distinct from the *structural* network density known more generally in network science. Without comparing to a reference data set, network density does not in itself indicate spatial data quality. For anyone familiar with the study area, network density can however indicate whether parts of the area appear to be under- or over-mapped.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "The density here is not based on the geometric length of edges, but instead on the computed length of the infrastructure. For example, a 100-meter-long bidirectional path contributes with 200 meters of bicycle infrastructure. This method is used to take into account different ways of mapping bicycle infrastructure, which otherwise can introduce large deviations in network density. With `compute_network_density`, the number of elements (nodes, dangling nodes, and total infrastructure length) per unit area is calculated. The density is computed twice: first for the study area for both the entire network ('global density'), then for each of the grid cells ('local density'). Both global and local densities are computed for the entire network and for protected and unprotected infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the analysis conducted here is intrinsic, i.e. it makes no use of external information, it cannot be known whether a low-density value is due to incomplete mapping, or due to actual lack of infrastructure in the area. However, a comparison of the grid cell density values can provide some insights, for example:\n",
    "* lower-than-average infrastructure density indicates a locally sparser network\n",
    "* higher-than-average node density indicates that there are relatively many intersections in a grid cell\n",

    "This section explores the geometric and topological features of the data. These are, for example, network density, disconnected components, and dangling (degree one) nodes. It also includes exploring whether there are nodes that are very close to each other but do not share an edge - a potential sign of edge undershoots - or if there are intersecting edges without a node at the intersection, which might indicate a digitizing error that will distort routing on the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the fragmented nature of most bicycle networks, many metrics, such as missing links or network gaps, can simply reflect the true extent of the infrastructure ([Natera Orozco et al., 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/gean.12324)). This is different for road networks, where e.g., disconnected components could more readily be interpreted as a data quality issue. Therefore, the analysis only takes very small network gaps into account as potential data quality issues.\n",

Typically, the vast majority of nodes in the non-simplified network will be of degree two; in the simplified network, however, most nodes will have degrees other than two. Degree two nodes are retained in only two cases: if they represent a connection point between two different types of infrastructure; or if they are needed in order to avoid self-loops (edges whose start and end points are identical) or multiple edges between the same pair of nodes. \n",

Further, the total number of nodes will see a strong decline. If the simplified graph still maintains a relatively high number of degree two nodes, or if the number of nodes with other degrees changes after the simplification, this might point to issues either with the graph conversion or with the simplification process.\n",

Dangling nodes can occur at actual dead-ends (representing a cul-de-sac) or at the endpoints of certain features, e.g. when a bicycle path ends in the middle of a street. However, dangling nodes can also occur as a data quality issue in case of over/undershoots (see next section). The number of dangling nodes in a network does to some extent also depend on the digitization method, as shown in the illustration below. \n",

An overshoot occurs when two features meet and one of them extends beyond the other. See the image below for an illustration.

For certain applications, such as routing, overshoots do not present a particular challenge; they can, however, pose an issue for other applications such as network analysis, given that they skew the network structure.  Undershoots, on the contrary, are a serious problem for routing applications, especially if only bicycle infrastructure is considered. They also pose a problem for network analysis, for example for any path-based metric, such as most centrality measures like betweenness centrality.\n",

    "### Component length distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of all network component lengths can be visualized in a so-called *Zipf plot*, which orders the lengths of each component by rank, showing the largest component's length on the left, then the second largest component's length, etc., until the smallest component's length on the right. When a Zipf plot follows a straight line in [log-log scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_scale), it means that there is a much higher chance to find small disconnected components than expected from traditional distributions [(Clauset et al., 2009)]( https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/070710111). This can mean that there has been no consolidation of the network, only piece-wise or random additions [(Szell et al., 2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-10783-y), or that the data itself suffers from many gaps and topology errors resulting in small disconnected components.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it can also happen that the largest connected component (the leftmost marker in the plot at rank $10^0$) is a clear outlier, while the rest of the plot follows a different shape. This can mean that at the infrastructure level, most of the infrastructure has been connected to one large component, and that the data reflects this - i.e. the data is not suffering from gaps and missing links to a large extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bicycle networks might also be somewhere inbetween, with several large components as outliers."
