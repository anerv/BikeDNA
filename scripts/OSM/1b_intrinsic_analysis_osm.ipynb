    "# 1b. Intrinsic Analysis of OSM Data\n",
    "This notebook analyzes the quality of OSM bicycle infrastructure data for a given area. The quality assessment is *intrinsic*, i.e. based only on the one input data set without makeing use of external information. For an extrinsic quality assessment that compares the OSM data to a user-provided reference data set, see the notebooks 3a and 3b.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis assesses the *fitness for purpose* ([Barron et al., 2014](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tgis.12073)) of OSM data for a given area. Outcomes of the analysis can be relevant for bicycle planning and research - especially for projects that include a network analysis of bicycle infrastructure, in which case the topology of the geometries is of particular importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the assessment does not make use of an external reference data set as the ground truth, no universal claims of data quality can be made. The idea is rather to enable those working with OSM-based bicycle networks to assess whether the data are good enough for their particular use case. The analysis assists in finding potential data quality issues but leaves the final interpretation of the results to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook makes use of quality metrics from a range of previous projects investigating OSM/VGI data quality, such as [Ferster et al. (2020)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15568318.2018.1519746), [Hochmair et al. (2015)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tgis.12081), [Barron et al.

    "### Network density\n",
    "\n",
    "In this setting, network density refers to the length of edges or number of nodes per km2. This is the usual definition of network density in spatial (road) networks, which is distinct from the *structural* network density known more generally in network science. Without comparing to a reference data set, network density does not in itself indicate spatial data quality. For anyone familiar with the study area, network density can however indicate whether parts of the area appear to be under- or over-mapped.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "The density here is not based on the geometric length of edges, but instead on the computed length of the infrastructure. For example, a 100-meter-long bidirectional path contributes with 200 meters of bicycle infrastructure. This method is used to take into account different ways of mapping bicycle infrastructure, which otherwise can introduce large deviations in network density. With `compute_network_density`, the number of elements (nodes, dangling nodes, and total infrastructure length) per unit area is calculated. The density is computed twice: first for the study area for both the entire network ('global density'), then for each of the grid cells ('local density'). Both global and local densities are computed for the entire network and for protected and unprotected infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the analysis conducted here is intrinsic, i.e. it makes no use of external information, it cannot be known whether a low-density value is due to incomplete mapping, or due to actual lack of infrastructure in the area. However, a comparison of the grid cell density values can provide some insights, for example:\n",
    "* lower-than-average infrastructure density indicates a locally sparser network\n",
    "* higher-than-average node density indicates that there are relatively many intersections in a grid cell\n",
    "* higher-than-average dangling node density indicates that there are relatively many dead ends in a grid cell\n",

    "## OSM tag analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "For many practical and research purposes, more information than just the presence/absence of bicycle infrastructure is of interest. Information about e.g. the width of the infrastructure, speed limits, streetlights, etc. can be of high relevance, for example when evaluating the bike friendliness of an area or an individual network segment. The presence of these tags describing attributes of the bicycle infrastructure is however highly unevenly distributed in OSM, which poses a barrier to evaluations of bikeability and traffic stress. Likewise, the lack of restrictions on how OSM features can be tagged sometimes result in conflicting tags which can undermine the evaluation of cycling conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section includes analyzes of missing tags (edges with tags that lack information), incompatible tags (edges with tags labelled with two or more contradictory tags), and tagging patterns (the spatial variation of which tags are being used to describe bicycle infrastructure).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the evaluation of tags, the non-simplified edges should be used to avoid issues with tags that have been aggregated in the simplification process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing tags\n",
    "\n",
    "The information that is required or desirable to obtain from the OSM tags depends on the use case - for example, the tag `lit` for a project that studies light conditions on cycle paths. The workflow below allows to quickly analyze the percentage of network edges that have a value available for the tag of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "We analyze all tags of interest as defined in the `existing_tag_analysis` section of `config.yml`. For each of these tags, `analyze_existing_tags` is used to compute the total number and the percentage of edges that have a corresponding tag value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "On the study area level, a higher percentage of existing tag values indicates in principle a higher quality of the data set. However, this is different from an estimation of whether the existing tag values are truthful. On the grid cell level, lower-than-average percentages for existing tag values can indicate a more poorly mapped area. However, the percentages are less informative for grid cells with a low number of edges: for example, if a cell contains one single edge that has a tag value for `lit`, the percentage of existing tag values is 100% - but given that there is only 1 data point, this is less informative than, say, a value of 80% for a cell that contains 200 edges.\n",

[Barron et al., 2014](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tgis.12073)), incompatible tags might be present in the data set.

    "### Tagging patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying bicycle infrastructure in OSM can be tricky due to the many different ways in which the presence of bicycle infrastructure can be indicated. The [OSM Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page) is a great resource for recommendations for how OSM features should be tagged, but some inconsistencies and local variations can remain. The analysis of tagging patterns allows to visually explore some of the potential inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of how the bicycle infrastructure is defined, examining which tags contribute to which parts of the bicycle network allows to visually examine patterns in tagging methods. It also allows to estimate whether some elements of the query will lead to the inclusion of too many or too few features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, 'double tagging' where several different tags have been used to indicate bicycle infrastructure can lead to misclassifications of the data. For this reason, identifying features that are included in more than one of the queries defining bicycle infrastructure can indicate issues with the tagging quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "We first plot individual subsets of the OSM data set for each of the queries listed in `bicycle_infrastructure_queries`, as defined in the `config.yml` file. The subset defined by a query is the set of edges for which this query is *True*. Since several queries can be *True* for the same edge, the subsets can overlap. In the second step below, all overlaps between 2 or more queries are plotted, i.e. all edges that have been assigned several, potentially competing, tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The plots for each tagging type allow for a quick visual overview of different tagging patterns present in the area. Based on local knowledge, the user may estimate whether the differences in tagging types are due to actual physical differences in the infrastructure or rather an artefact of the OSM data. Next, the user can access overlaps between different tags; depending on the specific tags, this may or may not be a data quality issue. For example, in case of `'cycleway:right'` and `'cycleway:left'`, having data for both tags is valid, but other combinations such as `'cycleway'='track'` and `'cycleway:left=lane'` gives an ambiguouos picture of what type of bicycle infrastructure is present.\n",

    "This section explores the geometric and topological features of the data. These are, for example, network density, disconnected components, and dangling (degree one) nodes. It also includes exploring whether there are nodes that are very close to each other but do not share an edge - a potential sign of edge undershoots - or if there are intersecting edges without a node at the intersection, which might indicate a digitizing error that will distort routing on the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the fragmented nature of most bicycle networks, many metrics, such as missing links or network gaps, can simply reflect the true extent of the infrastructure ([Natera Orozco et al., 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/gean.12324)). This is different for road networks, where e.g., disconnected components could more readily be interpreted as a data quality issue. Therefore, the analysis only takes very small network gaps into account as potential data quality issues.\n",

    "### Simplification outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare the structure and true ratio between nodes and edges in the network, a simplified network representation which only includes nodes at endpoints and intersections was created in notebook `1a` by removing all interstitial nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the degree distribution for the networks before and after simplification is a quick sanity check for the simplification routine. Typically, the vast majority of nodes in the non-simplified network will be of degree two; in the simplified network, however, most nodes will have degrees other than two. Degree two nodes are retained in only two cases: if they represent a connection point between two different types of infrastructure; or if they are needed in order to avoid self-loops (edges whose start and end points are identical) or multiple edges between the same pair of nodes. \n",

    "Typically, the degree distribution will go from high (before simplification) to low (after simplification) counts of degree two nodes, while it will not change for all other degrees (1, or 3 and higher). Further, the total number of nodes will see a strong decline. If the simplified graph still maintains a relatively high number of degree two nodes, or if the number of nodes with other degrees changes after the simplification, this might point to issues either with the graph conversion or with the simplification process."

Dangling nodes can occur at actual dead-ends (representing a cul-de-sac) or at the endpoints of certain features, e.g. when a bicycle path ends in the middle of a street. However, dangling nodes can also occur as a data quality issue in case of over/undershoots (see next section). The number of dangling nodes in a network does to some extent also depend on the digitization method, as shown in the illustration below. \n",

    "### Under/overshoots \n",
    "\n",
    "When two nodes in a simplified network are placed within a distance of a few meters, but do not share a common edge, it is often due to an edge over/undershoot or another digitizing error. An undershoot occurs when two features are supposed to meet, but instead are just in close proximity to each other. An overshoot occurs when two features meet and one of them extends beyond the other. See the image below for an illustration. For a more detailed explanation of over/undershoots, see the [GIS Lounge website](https://www.gislounge.com/digitizing-errors-in-gis/).\n",

    "*Left: Undershoots happen when two line features are not properly joined, for example at an intersection. Right: Overshoots refer to situations where a line feature extends too far beyond at intersecting line, rather than ending at the intersection.* \n",

    "**Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Undershoots:* First, the `length_tolerance` (in meters) is defined in the cell below. Then, with `find_undershoots`, all pairs of dangling nodes that have a maximum of `length_tolerance` distance between them, are identified as undershoots, and the results are plotted.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Overshoots:* First, the `length_tolerance` (in meters) is defined in the cell below. Then, with `find_overshoots`, all network edges that have a dangling node attached to them and that have a maximum length of `length_tolerance` are identifed as overshoots, and the results are plotted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method for over/undershoot detection is inspired by [Neis et al. (2012)](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/4/1/1).\n",

    "**Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Under/overshoots are not necessarily always a data quality issue - they might be instead an accurate representation of the network conditions or of the digitization strategy. For example, a cycle path might end abruptly soon after a turn, which results in an overshoot. Protected cycle paths are sometimes digitized in OSM as interrupted at intersections which results in intersection undershoots.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpretation of the impact of over/undershoots on data quality is context dependent. For certain applications, such as routing, overshoots do not present a particular challenge; they can, however, pose an issue for other applications such as network analysis, given that they skew the network structure.  Undershoots, on the contrary, are a serious problem for routing applications, especially if only bicycle infrastructure is considered. They also pose a problem for network analysis, for example for any path-based metric, such as most centrality measures like betweenness centrality.\n",

When a Zipf plot follows a straight line in [log-log scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_scale), it means that there is a much higher chance to find small disconnected components than expected from traditional distributions [(Clauset et al., 2009)]( https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/070710111). This can mean that there has been no consolidation of the network, only piece-wise or random additions [(Szell et al., 2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-10783-y), or that the data itself suffers from many gaps and topology errors resulting in small disconnected components.\n",
